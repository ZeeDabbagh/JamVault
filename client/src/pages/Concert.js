// Concert.js

//useQuery(LEt's us see all concerts in our database)
//_id
//artist
//venue
//date

//It will be an object, but eventually the concert data will be an array of concert objects
//Create a component to render a singleConcertInListPreview => props of the current concert we iterate through and render it to the page

// useQuery(//e can use the id of the selected conert to then fetch that specific concert and all associated posts)
// _id, artist, venue, date, description, posts { _id, user, postText}
// Create a component for every post in that conert, and have it receive the posts information (object) as props
